# Sentece Validate System

In this project, we will create a validator that checks pass-sentences instead of passwords.

# About the program

The program reads a file called input.txt with a sentence in each line. The program's task is to identify the correct sentences and print the number of correct sentences to the standard output.

# Sentence criteria
A statement is considered correct if:

-It consists of more than one word (separated by a space). \
-There is a punctuation mark ("!", "?", ".") at the end of the sentence.\
-It does not contain more than one occurrence of the same word. \
-Words contain only the letters of the English alphabet.\
-Words are written in lower case only.
