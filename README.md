# Sentece Validate System

In this project, we will create a password validator that checks pass-sentences instead of passwords for better security.

# About the program

The program reads a file called input.txt with a password in each line. The program's task is to identify the correct passwords and print the number of correct passwords to the standard output.

# Sentence criteria
A statement is considered correct if:

-It consists of more than one word (separated by a space).
-There is a punctuation mark ("!", "?", ".") at the end of the sentence.\
-It does not contain more than one occurrence of the same word.
-Words contain only the letters of the English alphabet.\
-Words are written in lower case only.

# Launching the program
To use the program, follow the steps below:

Download:

1) Go to: https://github.com/fulopco/pass_sentence_checker/releases 

2) Download pass_sentence_checker.jar. 

3) Create a new text file (.txt) with name: "input".

5) Open terminal (or cmd) in the files directory.
